                    Congratulations on your admission to The University of First Choice and Nationâ€™s Pride. We are delighted to welcome you to another new phase of your life, one that you can only experience once. The beauty of being a fresher is that you can only be a freshman once, after which you become a stay lite. Don't deny yourself the opportunity to create meaningful memories now that will last a lifetime. That's why we have made all the resources available to ensure you have a graceful experience on campus.

                    It's reassuring to know that it's not a crime to be a fresher or to be called one, as we were all once freshers ourselves. You can't become a stay lite unless you first experience being a fresher. So, while browsing through the content on this page, you will find all the necessary details to help you create wonderful memories on campus without making mistakes.
